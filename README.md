# Chaos-detection

The file contains folowing methods for chaos detection:  1. Box-counting dimension, 2. Correlation dimension, 3. Lyapunov exponent. 4. Recurrence quantification analysis - RR (reccurance rate), DET (determinism), ENTR (entropy), L (diagonal line length)

Folr all the methods there is several versions of them according to parameters and architecture.

There is demonstration of the methods on Logistic map and the grpahics shows the estimated value of chaos on the bifurcation diagram.
